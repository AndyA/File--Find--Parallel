=head1 NAME

File::Find::Parallel - Traverse a number of similar directories in parallel

=head1 VERSION

This document describes File::Find::Parallel version 0.53

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use File::Find::Parallel;

    my $ffp = File::Find::Parallel->new( qw( /foo /bar ) );

    print "Union:\n";
    my $union = $ffp->any_iterator
    print "  $_\n" while $_ = $union->();

    print "Intersection:\n";
    my $inter = $ffp->all_iterator
    print "  $_\n" while $_ = $inter->();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<File::Find> is the ideal tool for quickly scanning a single directory.
But sometimes it's nice to be able to perform operations on multiple
similar directories in parallel. Perhaps you need to compare the
contents of two directories or convert files that are shared in more
than one directory into hard links.

This module manufactures iterators that visit each file and directory in
either the union or the intersection of a number of directories. Hmm.
What does that mean?

Given two directory trees like this

    foo
    foo/a
    foo/b/c
    foo/d

    bar
    bar/a
    bar/b
    bar/e

you can choose to work with the intersection of the two directory
structures:

    .
    ./a
    ./b

That is the subdirectories and files that the F<foo> and F<bar> share.

Alternately you can work with the union of the two directory structures:

    .
    ./a
    ./b
    ./b/c
    ./d
    ./e

Still not clear? Well, if you wanted to do a recursive diff on the two
directories you'd iterate their union so you could report files that
were present in F<foo> but missing from F<bar> and vice-versa.

If, on the other hand you wanted to scan the directories and find all
the files that are common to all of them you'd iterate their
intersection and receive only files and directories that were present in
all the directories being scanned.

The C<any_iterator> and C<all_iterator> are built on a more general
purpose method: C<want_iterator>. If, for example, you want to make
links between files that are found in more than one directory you might
get your iterator like this:

    my $iter = $ffp->want_iterator( 2 );

The apparently magic '2' reflects the fact that if you're going to be
making links you need at least two files. No matter how many directories
you are iterating over in parallel you will only see files and
directories that appear in at least two of those directories.

File::Find::Parallel can scan any number of directories at the same
time. Here's an example (on Unix systems) that returns the list of all
files and directories that are contained in all home directories.

    use File::Glob ':glob';
    use File::Find::Parallel;

    my $find = File::Find::Parallel->new( bsd_glob( '/home/*' ) );

    my @common = ( );
    my $iter = $find->all_iterator;
    while ( defined my $obj = $iter->() ) {
        push @common, $obj;
    }

    print "The following files are common to ",
          "all directories below /home :\n";

    print "    $_\n" for @common;

For a complete concrete example of its use see L<lncopies> in the C<bin>
subdirectory of this distribution.

=head2 Iterators

The iterator returned by C<any_iterator>, C<all_iterator> or
C<want_iterator> is a code reference. Call it to get the next file or
directory. When all files and directories have been returned the
iterator will return C<undef>.

Once created an iterator is independent of the File::Find::Parallel
object that created it. If the object goes out of scope and is destroyed
during the life of the iterator it will still function normally.

You may have many active iterators for a single File::Find::Parallel
object at any time.

=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item C<< new >>

Create a new File::Find::Parallel. You may optionally pass a list of
directories to scan.

=item C<< set_dirs( @dirs ) >>

Set the list of directories to be scanned. Any number of directories may
be scanned. If you are scanning just a single directory consider using
L<File::Find> instead.

=item C<< get_dirs >>

Get the list of directories to be scanned.

    my @dirs_to_scan = $ffp->get_dirs;

=item C<< add_dirs >>

Add to the list of directories to be scanned.

    $ffp->add_dirs( 'a' );
    $ffp->add_dirs( 'b', 'c' );

=item C<< any_iterator >>

Get an iterator that will return the names of all the files and
directories that are in the union of the directories to be scanned.

The returned iterator is a code reference that returns a new name
each time it is called. It returns C<undef> when all names have
been returned.

The returned names are relative to the base directories. Given
directories like this

    foo             bar
    foo/a           bar/a
    foo/b/c         bar/d/e

the iterator would return

    .
    a
    b
    d
    b/c
    d/e

That is it returns the list of names that would result if F<foo> was
copied over F<bar> and then F<bar> scanned. Note that the starting
directory '.' is returned.

Directories are searched in breadth first order.

=item C<< all_iterator >>

Get an iterator that will return the names of all the files and
directories that are in the intersection of the directories to be
scanned.

Given directories like this

    foo             bar
    foo/a           bar/a
    foo/b/c         bar/d/e

the iterator would return

    .
    a

That is it returns the names of those files and directories that can be
found in both F<foo> and F<bar>.

=item C<< want_iterator( $threshold ) >>

Returns an iterator that returns all files and directories for which
there are at least the specified number of instances across all
directories being scanned. For example if you are scanning three
directories and you need to perform some operation whenever a particular
file is found in two or more of them:

    my $ffp = File::Find::Parallel->new( $dir1, $dir2, $dir3 );
    my $iter = $ffp->want_iterator( 2 );

    while ( my $obj = $iter->() ) {
        print "We have at least two copies of $obj\n";
    }

This is the primitive on which C<all_iterator> and C<any_iterator>
are built.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

The tests require L<File::Temp> and optionally L<Test::Pod::Coverage>
and L<Test::Pod>.

The L<lncopies> script requires L<Getopt::Long> and L<Pod::Usage>.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

I haven't checked but it must be slower than L<File::Find>. Use that
instead if you only want to scan a single directory at a time.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-file-find-parallel@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
